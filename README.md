This project was about creating a game of rock-paper-scissors, but we had to use our own theme. I chose a mafia themed based on the game Mafia. It uses the random function for the computer to cycle through the
choices while you manually choose yours. It has three game modes as choices in the beginning: Regular (5 rounds), Best 3 out of 5, and One Round. It also have a quit button in case you don't want to play.
